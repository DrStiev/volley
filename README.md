Check ambiental noise and set the volume of your pc to the appropriate level to hear clear but not damage your ears.
This idea is heavily influenced by [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20150511103431/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163341.aspx)

## Main Idea:
use the pc sensors to obtain a sample of the current environmental noise and adjust the volume level of the media accordingly.

1. Get sample values from the device's built-in microphone
2. Calculate loudness values
3. Adjust PC's current media volume's level
